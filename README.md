#DriftR

[DriftR deployed app](https://driftr-app.herokuapp.com/)

For this project, our team made an app where users can share fun facts/things about their favorite cities. Users can explore different cities that they can go on a particular city page, where it shows a picture of the city, and all users can share their posts. with Devise, users are able to sign up/sign in to view all cities. Some validations are applied on authenticatiion and new/edit post forms. Users can create posts to share things they like to do, view all other users' posts, and all comments on them. Only currently logged in user is edit and delete their own posts and comments.

Our team's approach, in addition to this project, was to gather and work cooperatively. We visually set up relatioships between each model/schema first so we understand data we're dealing with. Using trello, we approached our short goals step by step, checking off the checklists, achieving what our client would expect to see. Advantages of working together are such as learning better while we talk & discuss through codings, finding solutions to errors more quickly, and building code in a more efficient way.
Thank you!
